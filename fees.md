# Fees

### Fee Structure <a href="#_hlxrcyvlo425" id="_hlxrcyvlo425"></a>

Like all protocols, Gotchi Vault charges what we think are reasonable fees to incentivize users to keep their assets staked with the protocol.

_**Withdrawing GHST —**_ A 0.5% fee will be charged on all withdrawals of GHST from the protocol.

_**ERC721 —**_ a 10 GHST deposit will be required on the initial deposit of any Aavegotchi. You can batch deposit up to 10 Aavegotchis at once, and still pay a 10 GHST fee. This is a one-time fee, and you will still be able to temporarily pull your gotchi out of the vault to play minigames. Any withdrawal of your Aavegotchis is free, and you will not be charged any additional fees if you re-deposit within 24 hours of withdrawals.

_**Rental Splits —**_ final details of rental splits for Aavegotchi lending are still being finalized.

### Fee Distribution <a href="#_v7yicm5zmko9" id="_v7yicm5zmko9"></a>

50% of ALL fees will be sent back to the vGHST contract itself; this means that vGHST holders earn half of all fees. So when an Aavegotchi owner pays their 10 GHST deposit fee? Yup, the vGHST holders collectively just earned 5 GHST.

25% of fees go to the contract managers. During the initial 6 months of the protocol, this will be the Vault Managers described above (a multi-sig of 6 community members). Once control of the protocol is turned over to the DAO, VLT holders can reexamine how these fees are allocated

25% of fees go to the contract creators, a small group of individuals who conceptualized, and implemented the smart contracts and user interface.
